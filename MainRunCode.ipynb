radial velocity detection methods.', 'This galaxy, home to our solar system, stretches over 100,000 light-years and requires about 250 million years for our solar system to complete one orbit around its center.', 'This constellation, the third largest in the sky and known as the Great Bear, represents Callisto, a nymph loved by Zeus in Greek mythology.', 'This icy blue planet, first glimpsed by Galileo in 1612 and mathematically predicted in 1846, has seasons that each last over four decades due to its lengthy orbit around the Sun.', 'This moon, second largest in our solar system and

Ohio State University before his untimely death prevented him from reaching space.', 'This gas giant exoplanet, discovered by transit, is so close to its host star that tidal forces have stretched it into an egg shape and doomed it to be consumed in a few billion years.', 'This spiral galaxy, the closest to our Milky Way, was first documented in 964 by Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi in his Book of Fixed Stars.', 'This constellation, named for a son of Poseidon in Greek myth, features a belt, sword, and the red supergiant star Betelgeuse.', 'This gas giant’s spectacular rings, stretching over 175,000 miles, are thought to be made of remnants from asteroids, comets, and broken moons, while its atmosphere is dominated by hydrogen and helium.', 'This icy moon of Jupiter, known for its subsurface ocean and surface cracks caused by flowing liquid, shares an orbital resonance with Io and Ganymede.', 'This \"human computer\" at NASA calculated the orbital mechanics critical to the success of early crewed spaceflights and was one of the agency\\'s first Black female mathematicians, as depicted in the film Hidden Figures.', 'This super-hot gas giant, discovered via transit, is the darkest known planet, reflecting less light than coal, possibly due to titanium oxide in its atmosphere.', 'This elliptical galaxy, discovered in 1749 by Guillaume Le Gentil, orbits the Andromeda Galaxy and lies about 2.5 million lightyears from Earth.', 'This “W”-shaped constellation is named for a queen who was punished by Poseidon for her vanity in Greek mythology.', 'This scorching planet, one of only two in our solar system without moons, can reach surface temperatures as high as 900 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'This small, icy moon of Saturn is known for its highly reflective surface and is believed to harbor a subsurface ocean, making it a prime candidate in the search for extraterrestrial life.', 'This pioneering astronaut, the first American woman in space who operated the Challenger’s robotic arm, was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013.', 'This super Earth exoplanet, discovered via transit, may have started as a mini-Neptune

ten times higher than its neighbor Andromeda.', 'This constellation, shaped like a winged horse, represents the mythical creature born from Medusa’s blood and later ridden by Bellerophon to defeat the Chimera.', 'This ice giant, unique for spinning nearly on its side, boasts 28 moons and 13 rings in its orbit around the Sun.', 'This largest moon of Neptune is unique for its retrograde orbit and geological activity, and it remains tidally locked just like our own Moon.', 'This female astronaut, once stranded in space, held the record for the most total days and time outside the spacecraft for women until 2015, accumulating 608 days in orbit.', 'This \"hot Jupiter,\" the first exoplanet ever discovered, can reach scorching temperatures of up to 1830 degrees Fahrenheit and was suspected to have water vapor in its atmosphere as of 2017.', 'This galaxy’s “black eye” appearance comes from dark dust obscuring its bright core, and its outer gas rotates opposite to its inner gas—a sign of a past galactic collision.', 'This zodiac sign, symbolized by a centaur archer, not only marks the period from November 22 to December 21 but also points us toward the galactic center of the Milky Way.', 'This planet’s name, unlike its celestial neighbors, comes from a Germanic word meaning “the ground,” reflecting its unique status as the only known home to intelligent life.', 'This Martian moon, discovered in 1877, orbits its planet three times in a single day and lacks an atmosphere.', 'In 1788, this American astronomer accurately predicted a solar eclipse and crafted a wooden pocket watch that has kept precise time for over 40 years.']\n",
