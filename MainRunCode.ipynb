Having the answers to each fact makes it easier to specify to the LLM to not include the answer in the generated clue later in the code. This is also useful for showing the player the correct answer when they get a clue incorrect. \n",
        "- **create_clues():** Also from `AI_Setup.py`, this function takes `astro_jeopardy_facts.csv` and makes it into a one-dimensional array. Then, using the `prompt_llm()` function, each fact is iterated through a loop that uses an LLM to produce a Jeopardy-style clue based on the given fact. We made sure to be specific with our prompt, telling it to only respond with the produced clue and to not include the answer (which is also iterated through `prompt_llm()` in the same loop using `zip()`). Both the answer and clue arrays are reshaped into 5 by 6 arrays to match the board. (We used flattened arrays for this function because it was easier to zip the two arrays together and iterate through them.)\n",
        "- **generate_tiles():** This function comes from `clue_object_setup.py`. This python file sets up the main board made up of `Tile` objects. Each `Tile` contains a clue, answer, point value, whether or not it's the daily double, and if it's already been used. We will use these to call specific values stored in this object later on in the game. "
