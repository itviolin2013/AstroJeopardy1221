smell.', 'This galaxy, home to our solar system, stretches over 100,000 light-years and requires about 250 million years for our solar system to complete one orbit around its center.', 'This constellation, the third largest in the sky and known as the Great Bear, represents Callisto, a nymph loved by Zeus in Greek mythology.', 'This distant blue planet, first glimpsed by Galileo in 1612 and mathematically predicted in 1846, has seasons that each span over four decades due to its lengthy orbit around the Sun.', 'This moon, second largest in our solar system and unique for its dense atmosphere, is the only other place besides Earth known to have a rain-like cycle.', 'This 1967 Air Force officer, who earned a PhD in Physical Chemistry from Ohio State University, became the first black astronaut, leaving a legacy that opened doors for future generations despite never reaching space himself.', 'This gas giant exoplanet, discovered by transit, is so close to its host star that tidal forces have stretched it into an egg shape, sealing its fate as it spirals inward to eventual destruction.', 'This spiral galaxy, the closest to our Milky Way, was first documented in 964 by Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al Sufi in his Book of Fixed Stars.', 'This constellation, named for a legendary hunter and son of Poseidon, features a distinctive belt, sword, and the bright star Betelgeuse.', 'Category: Saturn\\n\\nThese spectacular features, stretching over 175,000 miles from the planet’s surface, are made up of fragments from asteroids, comets, and shattered moons orbiting a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.', 'This icy moon of Jupiter, known for its subsurface ocean and surface cracks caused by flowing liquid, shares an orbital resonance with Io and Ganymede.', 'This NASA mathematician, known as a \"human computer,\" calculated orbital mechanics crucial for crewed spaceflight and was one of the first Black women to work at NASA, as depicted in the film Hidden Figures.', 'This super-hot gas giant, discovered via transit, is the darkest known planet, reflecting less light than coal, likely due to titanium oxide in its atmosphere.', 'This elliptical galaxy, discovered in 1749 by Guillaume Le Gentil, orbits the Andromeda Galaxy and lies about 2.5 million lightyears from Earth.', 'This constellation, shaped like a distinctive \"W,\" honors a queen punished by Poseidon for her vanity in Greek mythology.', 'This scorching planet, one of only two in our solar system without moons, can reach surface temperatures as high as 900 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'This small, icy moon of Saturn boasts the most reflective surface in the solar system and is believed to harbor a subsurface ocean with the essential chemicals for life.', 'This pioneering astronaut, the first American woman in space and a skilled operator of the Challenger’s robotic arm, was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013.', 'This super-Earth exoplanet, discovered via transit, may have started as a mini-Neptune and regained its atmosphere through volcanic activity after initially losing it.', 'This third largest member of the Local Group, imaged by Hubble, boasts star formation rates about ten times higher than its neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy.', 'This constellation, shaped like a winged horse, represents the mythical creature born from Medusa’s blood and later ridden by Bellerophon to defeat the Chimera.', 'This ice giant, unique for spinning nearly on its side, boasts 28 moons and 13 rings in its orbit around the Sun.', 'This largest moon of Neptune is unique for its retrograde orbit and geological activity, and it remains tidally locked just like our own Moon.', 'This female astronaut, known for being stranded in space, held the record for the most total days and time outside the spacecraft until 2015, accumulating 608 days in orbit.', 'This \"hot Jupiter,\" the first exoplanet ever discovered, can reach scorching temperatures of up to 1830 degrees Fahrenheit and was suspected to have water vapor in its atmosphere as of 2017.', 'This galaxy’s “black eye” appearance comes from dark dust obscuring its bright core, and its outer gas rotates opposite to its inner gas—a sign of a billion-year-old galactic collision.', 'This zodiac sign, represented by a centaur in Greek mythology and spanning November 22 to December 21, also marks the location of the Milky Way’s center in its westernmost region.', 'This planet’s name, unlike its celestial neighbors, comes from a Germanic word meaning “the ground,” reflecting its unique status as the only known home to intelligent life.', 'This Martian moon, discovered in 1877, completes three orbits around Mars in a single day and lacks an atmosphere.', 'In 1788, this astronomer’s precise calculations allowed him to accurately predict a solar eclipse, and his wooden pocket watch has kept time for over 40 years.']\n"
