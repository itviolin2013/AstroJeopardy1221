The following is a discription given from Carmen. 

**Project 14: Astronomy Jeopardy Game Generator**
Build a fully functional Jeopardy-style astronomy game that generates questions from real astronomy facts and manages gameplay. The challenge is parsing factual content to create clever reverse-questions, implementing game logic with proper scoring, and maintaining the distinctive Jeopardy style while ensuring educational value.

Students collect astronomy facts from various sources (textbooks, NASA fact sheets, Wikipedia) and organize them into text files  by category. The system uses string manipulation to transform facts into Jeopardy-style answers, stores questions in nested dictionaries organized by category and dollar value, implements game state tracking with NumPy arrays (scores, question availability, 
Daily Doubles), and creates Matplotlib visualizations for score displays and game boards. The LLM API generates creative clues that hint at the answer without being too obvious, creates host commentary and fun facts, and evaluates whether player responses are acceptable variations of the correct question. Build Question and GameBoard classes to manage game state, implement file I/O to 
save/load game sets, use try/except for handling invalid player inputs, and apply control flow for game rules.

The minimal version creates one game board (6 categories, 5 questions each), uses dictionaries to track which questions have been asked, implements basic scoring with NumPy, generates clues viaLLM for each fact, and creates a simple text-based interface. Advanced versions might implement wagering for Daily Doubles and Final Jeopardy, use string similarity to accept approximate answers, build multiple difficulty levels by analyzing fact complexity, create themed weeks, generate contestant backstories and banter, implement timer functionality, visualize score progression throughout the game, or build a tournament mode tracking statistics across multiple games.

**More about our code:**

The goal of the code is to create a fully function jeopardy game that gives a player experience similar to one they would receive if on the show. To achieve a similar experience the code starts with asking basic information about the user that is usually shown when each player is introduced including: name, age, where you live, and occupation. The LLM utilizes the information given to ask to follow up questions and gives fun comments based on these different answers. We found that the instructions for what to say had to be very specific such as saying there could only be one question at a time, to stay on topic, and not to ask to many follow up questions. 

After these questions are asked, the LLM will ask the player if they are ready to start the game. After answering, the player will be prompted to choose a category and point value which is possible through the play function. The play function is defined through while true loops meaning if there is a typo in a category named, or a category that does not exist is chosen then the player will be asked to choose a valid category instead of the code crashing. The same is also true for the point value. This can be messed up as many times as possible without the code crashing. Originally this was done through if statements if a loop that meant there could only be one typo before the code would crash. 

After correctly answering the prompts, the player will then be asked a question based on the category and the point value. This is possible thanks to each of the tiles that make up the board. Each question (clue) is generated using the CSV files that contain the facts about each available category, and the LLM is specifically told not to use the answer in the generated clue. One other issue our group ran into was figuring out how to format the CSV files. Eventually, we were able to find a solution that had to be fixed later in the code that changes the clues to be formatted into an array using the reshape function. Within the board, we were also able to make a daily double that is assigned randomly depending on the game. 

The answer to the given clue must be generated as a question, and if it is not, the LLM will say to please answer as a question. Spelling errors are accounted for, and most will still be marked as correct. Another issue we came across at first was if a tile was not answered as a question, it would still be considered as used so if the player tried to run the tile again to format it correctly the code would crash. We were able to overcome this error by changing where the tile would be considered wrong. The point values add up or subtract based on whether the question is answered correctly or incorrectly. If the player want to exit at any point they are able to.
