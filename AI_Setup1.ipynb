system, is unique for its dense atmosphere and a rain-like cycle similar to Earth’s.', 'This 1967 Air Force officer, the first black astronaut, earned a PhD in Physical Chemistry from Ohio State University before his untimely death prevented him from reaching space.', 'This gas giant exoplanet, discovered by transit, is so close to its host star that tidal forces have stretched it into an egg shape and doomed it to be consumed in a few billion years.', 'This spiral galaxy, the closest to our Milky Way, was first documented in 964 by Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi in his Book of Fixed Stars.', 'This constellation, named for a mythical hunter and son of Poseidon, features a famous belt of three stars and includes the bright star Betelgeuse.', 'This gas giant, primarily made of hydrogen and helium like Jupiter, boasts rings stretching over 175,000 miles, formed from the remnants of asteroids, comets, and shattered moons.', 'This icy moon of Jupiter, locked in orbital resonance with Io and Ganymede, shows surface cracks likely caused by a subsurface ocean beneath its frozen crust.', 'This NASA mathematician, known as a \"human computer,\" calculated orbital mechanics crucial for crewed spaceflight and was one of the first Black women to work at NASA, as depicted in the film Hidden Figures.', 'This super-hot gas giant, discovered via transit, is the darkest known planet, reflecting less light than coal, possibly due to titanium oxide in its atmosphere.', 'This elliptical galaxy, discovered in 1749 by Guillaume Le Gentil, orbits the Andromeda Galaxy and lies about 2.5 million lightyears from Earth.', 'This constellation, shaped like a \"W,\" honors a queen punished by Poseidon for her vanity in Greek mythology.', 'This scorching planet, one of only two in our solar system without moons, can reach surface temperatures as high as 900 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'This small, icy moon of Saturn boasts the most reflective surface in the solar system and is believed to harbor a subsurface ocean with the essential chemicals for life.', 'This astronaut, the first American woman in space and a skilled robotic arm operator aboard the Challenger, was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013.', 'This super Earth exoplanet, discovered via transit, may have started as a mini-Neptune and is notable for losing and then regaining its atmosphere through volcanic activity.', 'This third largest member of the Local Group, imaged by Hubble, is known for its star formation rate about ten times that of its neighbor, Andromeda.', 'This constellation, shaped like a winged horse, represents the mythical creature born from Medusa’s blood and later ridden by Bellerophon to slay the Chimera.', 'This ice giant, unique for rotating nearly on its side, boasts 28 moons and 13 rings in its orbit around the Sun.', 'This largest moon of Neptune is unique for its retrograde orbit and geological activity, and it keeps one face always toward its planet, much like our Moon does with Earth.', 'This female astronaut, known for being stranded in space and holding the record for total days and time outside the spacecraft until 2015, spent a remarkable 608 days in orbit, the second highest for any woman.', 'This \"hot Jupiter,\" the first exoplanet ever discovered, can reach scorching temperatures up to 1830°F and was suspected to have water vapor in its atmosphere as of 2017.', 'This galaxy’s “black eye” appearance comes from dark dust obscuring its bright core, and its outer gas rotates opposite to its inner gas due to a past collision with a satellite galaxy.', 'This archer constellation, home to the Milky Way’s center, is symbolized by a half-human, half-horse figure in Greek mythology and marks birthdays from November 22 to December 21 in astrology.', 'This planet’s name, unlike those of Mars or Venus, comes from a Germanic word meaning “the ground,” and it’s the only known world to support intelligent life.', 'This Martian moon, discovered in 1877, orbits its planet three times in a single day and has no atmosphere.', 'This 18th-century astronomer not only predicted the positions of celestial bodies but also crafted a wooden pocket watch that kept precise time for over four decades.']\n"
